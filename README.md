# Datascience Project

## About the Project

The project was all about the influence of covid-lockdowns in 2020 on different (picked) crimes in Germany.
These figures were compared to the previous years (2015-2019).

## Prerequisite

* Python3
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## Usage

* Create all plots, that have any kind of markings (lockdown, ...):
> python3 plots_marked.py

* Create all plots, that have no markings:
> python3 plots_unmarked.py

All plots will be created in the directories plots_marked and plots_unmarked accordingly.
